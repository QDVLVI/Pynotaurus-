INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE GAME

=====================================================================================



You will need to use a terminal to run the game.


Ed Terminal:
    1.  Click the "Open Terminal" button
    2.  Type "python pynotaurus.py"

Local Terminal (may not support Colorama):
    1.  Download "pynotaurus.py"
    2.  Open "Terminal" on your computer
    3.  Type "cd {the file location here}"
    4.  Type "python3 pynotaurus.py"


Important Notes:
    1. The screen size of the game may be larger than your device. If it's too big,
       you are suggested to change your resolution settings to gain a better experience in playing.
    2. If you want to exit the game using "CTRL+C", you may need to do it twice
       because the game engine has code-error protection to prevent the game from shutting down.
    3. You are opted to not attempt to change or modify the codes in both "pynotaurus.py"
       and "game.log" files to avoid any code errors.
    4. The rules and instructions of the game are provided when you run the game.
